## Zoo

![Zoo](images/zoo.png)

Zoo is a low frequency (and ultra-low frequency) chaotic oscillator
that is programmable by the user with 3 configurable math formulas.

If you don't like algebra, Zoo also comes with plenty of example factory presets,
each of which generates a distinctive chaotic output:

The default is the [RÃ¶ssler attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6ssler_attractor).

### Mathematical basis

I created [Frolic](Frolic.md), [Glee](Glee.md), and [Lark](Lark.md) before Zoo.
They are all chaotic oscillators, each using a different attractor formula.
See the documentation links for the exact formulas used in each case.

All three attractor formulas follow the same pattern. In every case,
you model a particle in 3D space whose position vector is $(x, y, z)$.
In every time step,

$$
\dot{x} = f(x,y,z) \\
\dot{y} = g(x,y,z) \\
\dot{z} = h(x,y,z)
$$

Where the dotted letters $\dot{x}$, $\dot{y}$, $\dot{z}$ are derivatives with respect to time. For example,

$$
\dot{x}=\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}
$$

The functions $f$, $g$, and $h$ are particular to each kind of chaotic oscillator.

Zoo is a generalization of chaotic oscillators that use a particle's position to determine the direction and speed (the *velocity vector*) it must have at that moment in time. The velocity vector in turn causes a small update in position for each small time increment of the VCV Rack simulation.

### Entering formulas

Zoo's front panel looks just like Frolic, Glee, and Lark. All of the programmability options are in the right-click context menu:

The items `vx`, `vy`, `vz` are formula editors that allow you to enter in a simple algebra expression. You can use the operators `+`, `-`, `*` (multiply), and `/` (divide). You can also use `^` for exponentiation, but the exponent must be constant 1..4.

You are allowed to use the variables `x`, `y`, `z` for the particle's position, plus up to four adjustable parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`.

### Chaos mode

When you right-click on the CHAOS knob (or in the main context menu shown above), you will see


### Chaops on the left helps!

If you are programming a new chaotic oscillator in Zoo, I strongly recommend adding [Chaops](Chaops.md) to the left and [Tricorder](Tricorder.md) to the right:
