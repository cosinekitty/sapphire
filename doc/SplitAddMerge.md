## Split/Add/Merge

![Split/Add/Merge](images/splitAddMerge.png)

This utility splits, adds, and/or merges a stereo or 3D polyphonic signal with 2 or 3 monophonic signals.
This is like VCV Merge and VCV Split combined, but only for a maximum of 3 channels.
I chose 3 as the channel limit to support 3D vectors produced by
[Frolic](Frolic.md), [Polynucleus](Polynucleus.md), etc.
SplitAddMerge saves patch screen space because it is only 2 HP wide.

I created this module to save surface area in my patches.
Often I want to merge a pair of stereo signals into a single 2-channel polyphonic cable,
so that I can multiply both by the same envelope in a VCA, for example.

Usually I would use VCV Split and VCV Merge, but they are designed for up to 16 channels
and are larger than I need.

## Input Ports

The upper half of the panel includes 4 input ports.

The top 3 input ports are monophonic X, Y, and Z inputs.
Below it is a polyphonic P input.

Usually you plug monophonic cables into X, Y, or Z.
However, if any of these inputs has more than one channel, the channel voltages
are added to produce a single monophonic sum.

The polyphonic P input respects up to 3 channels in the input cable.
Any remaining channels are ignored.
Missing channels are treated as 0&nbsp;V.

## Output Ports

The lower half of the panel includes 4 output ports.

The top 3 output ports are monophonic X, Y, and Z outputs.
Below it is a polyphonic P output.
Both are different representations of the following sums:

* P[0] + X
* P[1] + Y
* P[2] + Z

Any missing inputs are treated as 0&nbsp;V, so using only the polyphonic input or only
the 3 monophonic inputs causes them to be copied to the output ports.

You can change the number of polyphonic channels in the output port P by right-clicking
on the Split/Add/Merge panel and sliding the channel count slider. The current output channel count is indicated by the LED-style numeric display in the uppper part of the panel.

## Examples

Here is an example of splitting a polyphonic 3D vector output from [Frolic](Frolic.md)
into its component voltages.

And here is an example of merging monophonic signals into a polyphonic signal:

If you provide both monophonic and polyphonic inputs, the signals get added.
This can be a handy way to create novel chaotic signals using a pair of simple chaotic oscillators.
The following example also demonstrates that you can place a [Tricorder](Tricoder.md)
immediately to the right of a Split/Add/Merge and it will graph the output vector.
