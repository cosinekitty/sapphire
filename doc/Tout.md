## Tout

Tout is the inverse of [Tin](Tin.md).

The name Tout stands for "Tricorder OUTput". Tout is an auxiliary output module for [Tricorder](Tricorder.md).
You can place Tout immediately to the right of a Tricorder to receive a copy of the vector it is graphing, along with a copy of the CLEAR trigger that was sent to ask Tricorder to clear its display.

Outputs are provided individually as monophonic X, Y, and Z ports.

They are also available together as a single 3-channel polyphonic (X, Y, Z) signal on the P port.

You can adjust the amplitude of the output vectors using the LEVEL knob, attenuverter, and CV input.

The LEVEL attenuverter knob supports a [low sensitivity option](LowSensitivityAttenuverterKnobs.md),
which is often helpful for making CV control easier to adjust.
