## Polynucleus

![Polynucleus](images/polynucleus.png)

Polynucleus is an alternative version of [Nucleus](Nucleus.md),
only with individual 3-channel polyphonic ports for input and output,
rather than triplets of monophonic ports.

Polynucleus is intended to be more convenient for workflows
oriented toward vectors and matrices.

The blank panel space in the lower left corner is reserved for
additional controls/inputs that are not yet ready for release.
In a future release, additional controls/inputs will be added here.
Any changes new enhancements will default to identical
behavior with the current version of Polynucleus, to avoid
unintentional changes to existing patches.

Polynucleus includes a CLEAR button that is absent in Nucleus.
Pressing this button resets the simulation so that it goes
back to its quiet initial state. This can be handy when the
simulation has become destabilized.

The CLEAR button does the same thing as the right-click menu option
"Reset simulation", only it allows you to hold the simulation
in its low energy state as long as you hold down the button.
It is also more convenient than the right-click option.
