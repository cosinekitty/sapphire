    <ul>
        <li>Added a <a href="LowSensitivityAttenuverterKnobs.md">low sensitivity</a> option to attenuverter knobs. Sometimes the adjustments were so tiny to get a desired affect that it was awkward to get it right. Low sensitivity mode allows you to more easily explore those delicate parameters!</li>
        <li>Tricorder's animation is much smoother now. I compensated for jitter caused by VCV Rack calling my animation update function at irregular time intervals.</li>
        <li>Tricorder now allows you to manually adjust its rotation speed using the right-click context menu. You can select any rotation speed from 0.01 RPM to 100 RPM.</li>
        <li>Tricorder: Fixed [Issue #40](https://github.com/cosinekitty/sapphire/issues/40): now you can right-click on the display area and the context menu will appear. Before, you had to click on the top of the panel to get the context menu to appear.</li>

<td align="left">
    <ul>
        <li>Added new module <a href="Polynucleus.md">Polynucleus</a>. This module is the same as <a href="Nucleus.md">Nucleus</a>, only with 3-channel polyphonic ports instead of triplets of monophonic ports.</li>
        <li>Added new module <a href="Tout.md">Tout</a>. This module can be placed to the right of a Tricoder to provide the vector that Tricorder is graphing as voltages on output ports. Tout is the inverse of <a href="Tin.md">Tin</a>.</li>
        <li>Added new module <a href="Hiss.md">Hiss</a> for generating unbiased vectors in an N-dimensional space.</li>
        <li>Nucleus <a href="https://github.com/cosinekitty/sapphire/issues/30">issue #30</a>: watch out for infinite/NAN input. If it happens, reset the internal state and keep going.</li>
        <li>Added a "reset simulation" command in the right-click menu that allows you to manually bring the particles to a halt. This can be handy when the simulation gets out of control in a way that does not trigger the NAN auto-reset mentioned above.</li>
        <li>Elastika, Nucleus, and Tube Unit now auto-reset if infinite/NAN output is detected, and indicate the problem by turning the OUTPUT level knob bright pink for 1 second, every time it happens.</li>
        <li>Frolic and Glee now provide an additional polyphonic output with the entire vector represented as a 3-channel port.</li>
        <li>Tin now provides an additional polyphonic input to feed in a 3-channel (X, Y, Z) input vector.</li>
        <li>Tin and Tout now have a LEVEL knob, attenuverter, and CV input. This allows them to adjust the magnitude of vectors that flow through them.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Added a new module: <a href="Nucleus.md">Nucleus</a>.</li>
        <li>Fixed issues where Elastika and Tube Unit did not persist AGC level or DC reject frequency. They were being reset to their default values every time a patch was loaded.</li>
        <li>Tricorder: the numeric display now includes a triangle that points up or down, depending on whether the value is increasing or decreasing.</li>
        <li>Tricorder: when first connected to a constant 0V input, immediately refresh the coordinate axes. Before this change, the display area stayed blank until the input voltage changed by more than 0.1V. This was confusing, because it looked like there is no input signal!</li>
        <li>Tricorder: Added a new command button `[]` to clear the path and start over with a fresh display.</li>
        <li>Tin: added a trigger input port that clears the Tricorder display.</li>
        <li>The modules that include an Automatic Gain Limiter (Elastika, Tube Unit, Nucleus) now allow the limiter to go as low as 1V, and the default has been changed from 8.5V to 4V. Backward compatibility is preserved: existing patches will still contain their original AGC settings, without any behavior changes.</li>

    Changes to Tube Unit:
    <li>Fixed display issues when there were multiple Tube Units in a patch, some with audio connected, others without. The yellow pathway around ROOT, DECAY, and ANGLE would sometimes be incorrectly shown/hidden.</li>
    <li>Added VENT/SEAL toggle menu option. Allows inverting the logic for the gate input.</li>

<td align="center">2.1.3</td>
<td align="left">
<ul>
    <li>
        Fixed a bug in the output level knob.
        It was incorrectly scaling the output level far too sensitively.
        Now the decibel value displayed by the knob exactly matches its actual amplification.
    </li>
    <li>
        Elastika now includes an adjustable output limiter.
        Before this was added, output levels could get VERY hot.
        The limiter mostly prevents the output amplitude from exceeding an adjustable level,
        although there can be brief transients after sudden changes.
        By default, the limiter is enabled and set to a threshold of 8.5V.
        Using Elastika's right-click context menu, you can adjust the limiter
        threshold anywhere from 5V to 10V. If you slide the limiter all the way
        to the right, it turns the limiter completely off.
        Disabling the limiter like this can result in extreme output voltages in
        some cases, but it could make sense for patches where Elastika's output
        is attenuated externally.

Improvements based on community feedback.
<ul>
    <li>Added bypass support for Elastika and Moots.</li>
    <li>Sum polyphonic inputs (audio and CV) in Elastika and Moots.</li>
    <li>Elastika checks for NAN outputs every quarter of a second and auto-recovers if found. (One user reported NAN output, but was not able to reproduce it, and I haven't see it happen yet.)</li>
    <li>Added right-click menu slider in Elastika to adjust output DC reject corner frequency. Default is 20 Hz, but can go up to 400 Hz.</li>
    <li>Prevent randomization of Elastika's input and output level knobs.</li>

Made the following fixes/improvements to Sapphire Moots:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/cosinekitty/sapphire/issues/1">Issue #1</a>:
        When a controller is turned off, no longer make the push-button
        completely dark. Instead, give it a very dim glow, so that it can still
        be seen when the room brightness is very dark.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/cosinekitty/sapphire/issues/2">Issue #2</a>:
        Added 5 options to the context menu, one for each controller, to
        enable/distable anti-click ramping. When enabled, the controller applies
        a 2.5 millisecond linear ramp before unplugging a cable and after plugging it back in.
        When disabled, the cable is plugged/unplugged instantly, which is usually
        a better choice for control voltages.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/cosinekitty/sapphire/issues/3">Issue #3</a>:
        Debounce gate voltages using hysteresis.
        Turn a controller on when its gate reaches 1.0V or higher.
        Turn it back off when the gate descends to 0.1V or lower.
    </li>
