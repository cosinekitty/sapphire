    The directory ${RACKTOOL} is missing.
    This is necessary for building the Sapphire plugin
    for all three target platforms: Linux, Mac, and Windows.
    For more info about cross-compiling VCV Rack plugins, see:
    https://github.com/VCVRack/rack-plugin-toolchain

    It is much simpler to build Sapphire for your own OS only.
    Read the following to set up your local development
    environment with the VCV Rack SDK:
    https://vcvrack.com/manual/PluginDevelopmentTutorial

    After completing those steps, run the following to
    build Sapphire and install it in VCV Rack on your system:

        make install
"

./codegen || exit 1

cd ${RACKTOOL} || Fail "Cannot change directory to ${RACKTOOL}"
rm -rf plugin-build
make plugin-build PLUGIN_DIR=${SAPPHIRE} || Fail "Error in `make plugin-build`"

Sapphire builds are available in:
"
realpath plugin-build
ls -l plugin-build
echo ""
cd ${SAPPHIRE} || Fail "Cannot change directory back to ${SAPPHIRE}"

echo "
